# Organ-Design
This is the files related to my own design of a home build organ

If possible I will here sync PCB files made in Keycad and documentation on the construction of a homemade small organ, with links to the CAD designs made in Onshape (and are therefor public by diffuolt as it's under the free verison 

This organ will be electtonicly controled via a custum PCB controled via an aurdino R3. Feedback is much apresiated.
